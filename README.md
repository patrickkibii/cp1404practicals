## About Me
- I am a passionate IT student who has had the dream of being a software engineer since elementary school. I like python and yearn to learn more. 
## Lessons learnt about "clean code" so far:
- DRY
- Use plural in naming lists
- Use "line" while using "for loop" in writing into a file I.e. for line in songs
                                                                    print(song)
- Never use While True unless you get your answers from an AI
